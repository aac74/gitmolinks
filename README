Instructions for using Github:

1) setup your githib account

2) go to the gnr page on github and press the fork button to get the files in your account:
https://github.com/gnrpodcast/gitmolinks/

3) go to your page and click on the file you want to edit e.g. gnrlinks.opml
(just click the 'edit file' button and copy/paste the text into a local editor - e.g. the OPML editor - and paste it back in when you finish your edit)

4) when finished editing click the commit button

5) when ready make the pull request

6) your fork will become out of date as changes are committed upstream.
Thus before editing files you need to patch your fork to get the latest file versions.
Click 'fork queue' to patch your fork.
Click 'network' to see a history of file changes in each author/committer's fork
